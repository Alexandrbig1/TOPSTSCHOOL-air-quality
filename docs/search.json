    "text": "Welcome to the second module of the SCHOOL curriculum!\nThe Science Core Heuristics for Open Science Outcomes in Learning (SCHOOL) is part of the NASA Transform to Open Science (TOPS) Training (TOPST) initiative, designed to teach the data science lifecycle using data from the NASA Earth Sciences division and to foster an inclusive culture of open science. You can learn more about the SCHOOL Project and other modules on the SCHOOL Project home page.\nThe second SCHOOL module on the theme of “Air Quality and Health” explores how particulates in the air impact humans and how they are affected by the changes in air quality. The module consists of three use cases that cover examples of …… and …. such as …..\nEach use case uses a unique dataset to walk users through lessons in accessing and analyzing data, and further adapting the code to perform their analyses including data cleaning, processing to subset to an area of interest, and creating visualizations to share what they have learned with their communities.\nThis module is tailored to instruct undergraduate students and early-career researchers with some coding language exposure about the data science life cycle, illustrating how Open Science principles can be effectively applied to earth sciences, particularly in the context of water.\nThe SCHOOL Modules do not intend to teach all-encompassing earth science lessons nor provide learners with total coding expertise. Instead, the SCHOOL Project aims to provide users with the skills to adapt the SCHOOL lessons to the users’ own Open Science workflow. To learn more about Open Science, explore NASA’s TOPS Open Science 101 Curriculum. To explore other themes in the SCHOOL project, visit our Modules Page.\nModule 2: Air Quality datasets and use cases cover:\n\nEnabling Student-led Air Quality and Extreme Temperature Monitoring in New York: Examining the relationship between two environmental hazards – hazardous air quality and temperature – and socioeconomic characteristics of New York State (NYS) schools.\n\nLesson 1: Acquiring, Pre-Processing, and Visualizing Student-Monitored Data for New York City (NYC) Schools\n\nEJSCREEN: Environmental justice mapping and screening tool that helps users understand the environmental and demographic characteristics of a specific area.\n\nLesson 2: Exploring the EJSCREEN tool\n\nSocial Vulnerability Index (SVI): Exploring social determinants of health within the USA.\n\nLesson 3: Social Vulnerability Index (SVI): Social Determinants of Health\n\nGlobal (GL) Annual PM2.5 Grids from MODIS, MISR and SeaWiFS Aerosol Optical Depth: Global particulate matter concentrations over years.\n\nLesson 4: Global (GL) Annual PM2.5 Grids\n\n\n\nStart Lesson 1\n\nThis course was made possible thanks to the work of our NASA Transform to Open Science (TOPS) team, our SCHOOL Open Science team, open science Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), and the SCHOOL Development team!"

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nThis project, “Enabling Student-led Air Quality and Extreme Temperature Monitoring in New York,” led by Carolynne Hultquist and her team, aims to engage students in monitoring environmental hazards, specifically hazardous air quality and extreme temperature, outside and inside New York State schools. The focus is on New York City (NYC) schools serving low-income minority populations located in environmental justice communities characterized by high levels of hazard exposure. By incorporating mobile and static monitoring techniques, students contribute to data collection and analysis, integrating satellite data and sensor networks. This initiative not only provides valuable data on environmental conditions but also educates students on the principles of open science and the data science life cycle."

    "text": "Introduction\nIn recent years, researchers have explored the intersection between environmental factors and public health, particularly concerning diseases like COVID-19 and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Studies have highlighted the impact of air pollution on disease susceptibility and outcomes, emphasizing the need for rigorous analysis and understanding of these relationships. This overview focuses on several key studies that utilize data science principles to investigate how environmental justice, air pollution, and demographic factors intersect, providing insights that contribute to open science principles and the data science life cycle."

Visualize data using plots and charts to identify patterns and correlations between environmental factors, demographic variables, and health outcomes. Perform statistical tests to assess associations and identify potential confounding factors.\n\n\nModel Development and Analysis\nApply statistical models (e.g., regression analyses, machine learning algorithms) to quantify the relationships between environmental exposures and health outcomes. Adjust for confounders such as demographic characteristics (e.g., age, race/ethnicity) and socioeconomic factors (e.g., income, education). Validate models using cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness and generalizability of findings.\n\n\nInterpretation and Communication of Results\nInterpret findings in the context of environmental justice principles, highlighting disparities and vulnerabilities observed in different populations. Discuss implications for public health policy and environmental regulations based on study outcomes. Communicate results transparently using accessible language and visual aids to engage stakeholders and the broader community."
