    "text": "Welcome to the second module of the SCHOOL curriculum!\nThe Science Core Heuristics for Open Science Outcomes in Learning (SCHOOL) is part of the NASA Transform to Open Science (TOPS) Training (TOPST) initiative, designed to teach the data science lifecycle using data from the NASA Earth Sciences division and to foster an inclusive culture of open science. You can learn more about the SCHOOL Project and other modules on the SCHOOL Project home page.\nThe second SCHOOL module on the theme of “Air Quality and Health” explores how particulates in the air impact humans and how they are affected by the changes in air quality. The module consists of three use cases that cover examples of …… and …. such as …..\nEach use case uses a unique dataset to walk users through lessons in accessing and analyzing data, and further adapting the code to perform their analyses including data cleaning, processing to subset to an area of interest, and creating visualizations to share what they have learned with their communities.\nThis module is tailored to instruct undergraduate students and early-career researchers with some coding language exposure about the data science life cycle, illustrating how Open Science principles can be effectively applied to earth sciences, particularly in the context of water.\nThe SCHOOL Modules do not intend to teach all-encompassing earth science lessons nor provide learners with total coding expertise. Instead, the SCHOOL Project aims to provide users with the skills to adapt the SCHOOL lessons to the users’ own Open Science workflow. To learn more about Open Science, explore NASA’s TOPS Open Science 101 Curriculum. To explore other themes in the SCHOOL project, visit our Modules Page.\nModule 2: Air Quality datasets and use cases cover:\n\nEnabling Student-led Air Quality and Extreme Temperature Monitoring in New York: Examining the relationship between two environmental hazards – hazardous air quality and temperature – and socioeconomic characteristics of New York State (NYS) schools.\n\nLesson 1: Acquiring, Pre-Processing, and Visualizing Student-Monitored Data for New York City (NYC) Schools\n\nEJSCREEN: Environmental justice mapping and screening tool that helps users understand the environmental and demographic characteristics of a specific area.\n\nLesson 2: Exploring the EJSCREEN tool\n\nSocial Vulnerability Index (SVI): Exploring social determinants of health within the USA.\n\nLesson 3: Social Vulnerability Index (SVI): Social Determinants of Health\n\nGlobal (GL) Annual PM2.5 Grids from MODIS, MISR and SeaWiFS Aerosol Optical Depth: Global particulate matter concentrations over years.\n\nLesson 4: Global (GL) Annual PM2.5 Grids\n\n\n\nStart Lesson 1\n\nThis course was made possible thanks to the work of our NASA Transform to Open Science (TOPS) team, our SCHOOL Open Science team, open science Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), and the SCHOOL Development team!"

The focus is on New York City (NYC) schools serving low-income minority populations located in environmental justice communities characterized by high levels of hazard exposure. By incorporating mobile and static monitoring techniques, students contribute to data collection and analysis, integrating satellite data and sensor networks. This initiative not only provides valuable data on environmental conditions but also educates students on the principles of open science and the data science life cycle.\n\n\n\n\n\nEquip students with mobile sensors to collect air quality data. Compare this with data from static sensors placed in schools and remote sensing sources.\n\n\n\nUtilize satellite data such as MODIS, OMI, MERRA-2, GOES, CHIRTS-daily, and SEDAC’s Air Quality Data to complement ground data.\n\n\n\nStudents upload collected data to an online platform, ensuring proper documentation and metadata inclusion to maintain data quality and integrity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck for inconsistencies or anomalies in the collected data. This includes cross-referencing mobile sensor data with static and satellite data to ensure accuracy.\n\n\n\nApply techniques such as interpolation or imputation to address missing data points, ensuring a complete dataset for analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate basic statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) to understand the distribution and central tendencies of the data.\n\n\n\nExamine relationships between air quality, temperature, and socioeconomic characteristics of the schools.\n\n\n\nUse tools like ArcGIS Online for participatory mapping and visualizations to represent data spatially and temporally. Modeling and Interpretation\n\n\n\nDevelop models to predict air quality and temperature variations based on historical data and current trends. Impact Analysis: Assess the health impacts of hazardous air quality and extreme temperatures on school populations, with a focus on vulnerable groups. Reporting and Communication\n\n\n\nEngage with the Solutions Journalism Network to develop stories that highlight the project’s findings and advocate for environmental justice. ### Publications and Presentations Compile findings into reports, articles, and presentations for dissemination through academic channels and public forums.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure all data processing steps, methodologies, and code are well-documented and accessible. ### Reproducibility Provide clear instructions and datasets for others to replicate the study. ### Data Sharing Publish datasets and findings in open-access repositories to promote further research and collaboration.\nCongratulations! …. Now you should be able to:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this lesson, we explored ….\nLesson 2: Particulate Matter 2.5"
