## Introduction
### What is EJScreen?
EJScreen, the Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool, was developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to help identify and address environmental justice issues. The tool is designed to provide communities, NGOs, and policymakers with vital data on environmental and demographic factors that affect vulnerable populations. 

### Background on the development of EJScreen
The concept of environmental justice gained prominence in the 1980s and 1990s when it became clear that certain communities, especially low-income and minority populations, were disproportionately affected by environmental hazards. This concern led to the signing of Executive Order 12898 in 1994, which directed federal agencies, including the EPA, to address environmental justice in minority and low-income populations [https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-executive-order-12898-federal-actions-address-environmental-justice]

### Importance of EJScreen
EJScreen is important in empowering communities. Access to EJScreen helps communities understand the specific environmental challenges they face, such as pollution levels or exposure to hazardous substances. By providing this data, the tool empowers residents to advocate for their health, safety, and well-being. According to the EPA, EJScreen allows communities to participate more effectively in public discussions, regulatory processes, and decision-making, backed by concrete data to support their concerns and needs. Environmental justice focuses on ensuring that no group of people, particularly minority and low-income communities, bears a disproportionate share of environmental burdens.[https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/what-ejscreen]
Environmental and social justice organizations often rely on data to build and support their campaigns. EJScreen provides this kind of data, which can highlight environmental injustices and help NGOs propose solutions and mobilize public support. Many NGOs also use these tools to strengthen their grant applications, demonstrating the specific needs of the communities they serve. This is especially important for organizations advocating for low-income and minority populations, who are often disproportionately impacted by environmental hazards.
Policymakers require accurate data to create effective and equitable regulations. EJScreen helps identify areas of concern, prioritize actions, and design policies that better protect vulnerable populations. For example, the EPA uses this tool to inform regulatory actions, compliance monitoring, and enforcement activities.[https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice].
By making environmental data accessible to the public, EJScreen also promotes transparency and helps hold governments and industries accountable for their environmental impact. This public accessibility allows for trust and collaboration between communities, regulatory agencies, and policymakers, which is crucial for successfully implementing environmental policies [https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/national-environmental-justice-advisory-council].
Environmental issues often require collaborative solutions involving multiple stakeholders, such as government agencies, NGOs, businesses, and community groups. EJScreen provides a common platform for discussing and addressing these challenges, which fosters more effective partnerships and solutions.
EJScreen’s development reflects the EPA's commitment to enhancing the accessibility of environmental data, promoting transparency, and addressing environmental justice concerns by equipping all stakeholders with the tools needed to assess and respond to environmental health disparities.

## Exploring EJScreen
Now we are going to explore the EJScreen website.
Type in “Metro Detroit”, you should get a zoomed in region of the metropolitan region of Detroit.

Notice the EJScreen Community Report, Explore charts, etc. We can use that to view statistical reports once we overlay the data.

Lets view people of color.

We will now download a shapefile from Wayne County, the most populous county in Michigan [source]. The page has different datasets under the label “GIS Data”, including “Comission Districts”, “Municipal Boundaries”, etc. Please click on the one labeled “Zip Codes”. A zip file will immediately download. Once it is done downloading, unzip the contents into a folder.

Next, go to tools, add shapefile, select shapefile


Congratulations! .... Now you should be able to:
