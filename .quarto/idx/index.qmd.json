You can learn more about the SCHOOL Project and other modules on the [SCHOOL Project home page.](https://ciesin-geospatial.github.io/TOPSTSCHOOL/)\n\nThe second SCHOOL module on the theme of \"Water and related-resources\" explores how the water cycle impacts humans and how they are affected by the changes. The module consists of three use cases that cover examples of ...... and .... such as .....\n\nEach use case uses a unique dataset to walk users through lessons in accessing and analyzing data, and further adapting the code to perform their analyses including data cleaning, processing to subset to an area of interest, and creating visualizations to share what they have learned with their communities.\n\n**This module is tailored to instruct undergraduate students and early-career researchers with some coding language exposure about the data science life cycle, illustrating how Open Science principles can be effectively applied to earth sciences, particularly in the context of water.**\n\nThe SCHOOL Modules do not intend to teach all-encompassing earth science lessons nor provide learners with total coding expertise. Instead, the SCHOOL Project aims to provide users with the skills to adapt the SCHOOL lessons to the users' own Open Science workflow.
